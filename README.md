# Global-YouTube-Statistics-Analysis

Data analysis in Python using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and NumpPy 

### **Situation**
As many other people, I enjoy watching Youtube videos to disconnect and educate myself, which sparked my curiousity about what actually makes for a succesfull Youtube channel. Based on this interest I set out on conducting an analysis that would provide me with insights into the key elements that make up a great Youtube channel, understanding the trends of successful channels and to get an interest into the potential corelation betwen the two 

### **Task**

Prior to conducting the data anslysis, I identified the aim of the project and broke it down iinto several research questions, which would act as out North Star for the project.
